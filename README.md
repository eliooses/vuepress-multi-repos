## üë®‚Äçüíª About <a name="about"></a>

[VuePress for multiple repositories](https://github.com/eliooses/vuepress-multi-repos) is an experimental repository with the purpose of obtaining automagically the complete list of repositories of an organization, user, product or group of them and gathering all their documentation in one place.

---

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development, testing and production purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

This is a very simple project that uses the VueJs framework to publish documentation from a group of repositories of an organization, user, product, etc. from an external API ([GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest)).

### Prerequisites:

**Git**: [https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

**GitHub CLI**: [https://cli.github.com/](https://cli.github.com/)

**Node**: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

**NPM**: [https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

**NPX**:

```bash
npm install -g npx
```

How to check if installations succeeded:

```bash
git version
```
```bash
gh version
```
```bash
node -v
```
```bash
npm -v
```
```bash
npx -v
```
---

Open your terminal and type:

```bash 
gh repo clone eliooses/vuepress-multi-repos
```

**NOTE**: If you don¬¥t have experience with terminals (it will be a problem for what follows, but at least in this step you have a visual interface alternative), you can open the [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) in your OS and go to `File` > `Clone Repository` > `URL` tab and type:
```
eliooses/vuepress-multi-repos
```
After, just click the `CLONE` button.

Finally you have the simplest option: download and unzip the following `.zip` file with all the files and resources:

[https://github.com/eliooses/vuepress-multi-repos/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/eliooses/vuepress-multi-repos/archive/master.zip)

After that, just type the following instructions:

```bash 
cd vuepress-multi-repos
```

```bash 
npm i
```

Open your favorite IDE and edit the `.env` file with your target ID, for example:

```text 
# Set your ID TYPE ("orgs" or "users")
REPO_TYPE_ID=orgs

# Set your USER ID
REPO_USER_ID=zondax
```

Run the `get-repos.js` file with the following command (this get the complete list of repositories of your target ID):
```bash 
npm run repos
```

Run the `git-submodules.sh` file with the following command (this will download all the repositories to your hard disk):
```bash 
npm run submodules
```

Run the `remove-undesirable-files.sh` file with the following command (this will delete all the unnecessary files on the repositories):
```bash 
npm run remove-files
```

Create a installation of VuePress with the following command:
```bash 
npx create-vuepress-site
```
Follow the Vuepress instructions.

After that, edit `config.js` file:
```javascript
module.exports = {
    ...
    themeConfig: {
        sidebar: [],
        sidebarDepth: 2
    ...
```

With the following commands we will generate an auto sidebar for the documentation:
```bash 
cd docs/src
npx vuepress-auto-sidebar
cd ../..
```

Finally we will build the site:
```bash 
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" npx vuepress build docs/src
```
